The team is developing a system that is able to create ground truth maps in real time from an altitude of at least 250 meters AGL. The teams approach uses a combination of lidar systems and reflective grid patterns to meet the requirements for the technology

Mission Requirements:
- GSD = 10cm
- Elevation Accurary = 5cm 
- Altitude = 250-500 m
- Time = Real Time


The technology will undergo a subortibal test flight to accurately simulate a lunar lander in spring of 2023.
